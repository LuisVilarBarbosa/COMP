** SUMMARY: 

An autotuner for C programs. The user adds pragmas to the source code and the auto-tuner automatically determines the best values for some constants.
Pragmas must be within functions, the programmer has to declare the variable of the first pragma and initialize the variable of the second pragma before the scope of these.

The available pragmas are:
1. #pragma tuner explore STEP(x,y) reference(STEP=z) (x > y, y > z > x, step is 1)
   #pragma tuner max_abs_error acc e
2. #pragma tuner explore STEP(x,y,z) reference(STEP=k) (x > y, y > k > x, z is the step)
   #pragma tuner max_abs_error acc e
3. #pragma tuner random RANDOM(x,y,N) reference(RANDOM=z) (x > y, y > z > x, N is the number of random numbers to generate)
   #pragma tuner max_abs_error acc e


** EXECUTE: 

Initially, the files that are generated by JJTree and JavaCC are already in the JJTree folder. 
However, if you prefer to generate new files you can run the script 'JJTreeRunner', considering your operating system.
After that, go to the scripts folder and run the script 'CompileAuto', followed by 'ExecuteAuto', considering your operating system.
 
**DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS:

The syntactic analyser is implemented in JJTree. If any error occur, our tool goes to the next test file.
 
**SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:

In our tool, we consider important to implement five semantic rules. They are:
- Verify if the pragma data types are equal: we look for all the values used in the pragma, and make sure that they are all integers or doubles.
- Verify if the interval indicated in the pragma is in the correct order.
- Verify if is possible to pass through the value referenced in the pragma, considering the interval that is declared, and the step.
- Verify if for each starting pragma exists a compatible ending pragma.
- Verify if a pragma only refers to one variable.

Everytime this verifications don't apply, an exception is raised with an appropriate message.
 
**INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs): 

Considering the pragmas from the summary section, these are their HIRs:

1.

tuner
 explore
  STEP
   x
   y
  reference
   STEP
   z
 max_abs_error
  acc
  e

2.

tuner
 explore
  STEP
   x
   y
   z
  reference
   STEP
   k
 max_abs_error
  acc
  e

3. 

tuner
 random
  RANDOM
   x
   y
   N
  reference
   RANDOM
   z
 max_abs_error
  acc
  e
 
**CODE GENERATION: (when applicable, describe how the code generation of your tool works and identify the possible problems your tool has regarding code generation.)
 
At this stage, we check in all pragmas if some of them have the same name. If not, we proceed to change the C code.
We have templates and change them with the correct information according to the file that is being used.
After that, a file with the new code is created and executed.
 
**OVERVIEW: (refer the approach used in your tool, the main algorithms, the third-party tools and/or packages, etc.)
 
**TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: (Describe the content of your testsuite regarding the number of examples, the approach to automate the test, etc.)
 
In order to test our tool, we have six test files in the folder 'c_files' that are always run when we execute our tool.
With that, we can always test if our modifications are correct, in order to improve our compiler.
 
**TASK DISTRIBUTION:

Diogo:
Luís:
Paulo: Implemented pragma STEP(x,y,z), developed functions in semantic analysis and in code changer, helped in pragma random.
Sérgio: Implemented pragma RANDOM(x,y,z) and some functions in semantic analysis, including changes on templates.
 
**PROS: 

We think that our tool is very well structured and is easy to implement more pragmas if we want to add more.
It can be executed in Windows or Linux.
Is very complete in terms of verifications, always giving messages to the user when something goes wrong.

 
**CONS: 

A possible improvement would be to send the time printfs to a file in code C.
